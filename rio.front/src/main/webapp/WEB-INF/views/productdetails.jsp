				<h3>Dead Space 3 Limited Edition[$20.00]</h3>

				<p>Dead Space 3 is a science fiction survival horror video game developed by Visceral Games and published by Electronic Arts. Announced at E3 2012 and released internationally in February 2013,[2] it is the sequel to Dead Space 2 and the third main entry in the Dead Space series.[3]
In Dead Space 3, Isaac Clarke teams up with EarthGov Sergeant John Carver as they travel to Tau Volantis, an ice-covered planet, to end the Marker and Necromorph threat for good.
Development of the game began after the completion of Dead Space 2. It is the first game in the Dead Space series to feature online co-op.
The game received positive reviews from game critics upon release; reviewers praised the game's rewarding action gameplay, although criticism was directed at the focus on action over horror, as well as a weak and unfocused story compared to its predecessors. Dead Space 3 sold 605,000 copies and became less successful than its predecessors. Despite poor sales, EA and Visceral expressed interest in a sequel.
